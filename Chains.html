		<h2>Summary of whole book</h2>
		<a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
		<div class="content">
			Chains opens with a funeral, which pretty much tells us up front that it's going to be a pretty bleak story. Isabel, our heroine, and her younger sister, Ruth, are attending the burial of their owner, Miss Mary Finch. The occasion presents a great deal of hope for Isabel and Ruth, as Miss Finch planned to free the girls in her will. When Isabel confronts Miss Finch's brother about this, though, he basically thinks she's making it up.

To make matters worse, her lawyer is stuck in Boston, where a major uprising has just taken place over the British colonies' desire for independence. As a result, Isabel's hopes turn to dust.

We'd like to say that somebody texts the lawyer and he makes an emergency trip to Rhode Island to sort stuff out, but unfortunately (a) that doesn't happen, and (b) it's 1776, so that's impossible anyway.

Instead, Miss Finch's brother sells Isabel and Ruth to Anne and Elihu Lockton, two rich British merchants from New York who are loyal to their country in the independence conflict. They're also not very nice people, especially Anne, who makes the girls call her "Madam" and is basically Mommie Dearest, Cruella DeVille, and the wicked stepmother from Cinderella all rolled into one. Ouch. Sounds like a winner.

As she goes about her duties, Isabel befriends Curzon, a slave who works for Mr. Bellingham, one of the chief law enforcement officials for the Patriots. He tells her that if she hears Lockton, Madam, or any of their Loyalist friends talk about sensitive information related to the conflict, sharing it could likely buy the freedom owed to her and Ruth. Isabel initially rejects his offer, saying that her job is to take care of her sister and she cannot put her sister in jeopardy.

Meanwhile, life at the Locktons' gets pretty difficult for the girls. Madam verbally abuses Isabel and makes Ruth into her personal servant. When Isabel comes into Madam's chamber one day to find Ruth crying, she realizes that they need to get away from the Locktons once and for all. She overhears Lockton and some of his Loyalist friends talking about money they have hidden away in a linen chest to bribe the rebel army with, and Isabel makes a daring, dangerous journey to Bellingham's in the middle of the night to pass the news onto Curzon.

The next day, Patriot officials come to search the Locktons' house. This initially overjoys Isabel, until she learns that Lockton hid the money somewhere else because he figured they'd be stopping by. Lockton is arrested under suspicion of treason, but the powerful influence of his aunt, Lady Seymour, allows him to be set free the next day.

Several days later, Isabel overhears Lockton and his friends plotting to kill General George Washington. She goes to Bellingham's associate, Colonel Regan with the news, and he promises to look into hers and Ruth's case in exchange for the valuable information. Lockton flees to England once he hears that the plot has been discovered.

Ruth is plagued by frequent seizures, which make Madam believe she's demon-possessed. As a result, she sells Ruth after giving Isabel a sedative in a milk beverage to keep her from fighting back. When Isabel learns the truth, she confronts Madam, who has her arrested and branded on her cheek with the letter I for insolence. With two failed attempts at seeking help from the Patriots and her sister now long gone, Isabel feels more hopeless than ever.

Curzon comes to see Isabel and tells her how sorry he is that things didn't work out. He explains that Bellingham has asked him to take his place and fight on the American side in the war. Isabel also hears rumors that the British intend to free any slaves who will run away and support them, so she decides to give this a try and heads to a British ship when Madam sends her to run errands. Unfortunately, no one will accept her help. She does, however, experience a welcome break when Lockton farms her out to help Lady Seymour, who is in poor health.

Things get worse when New York City literally catches on fire and the blaze destroys a giant chunk of the city. Isabel rescues Lady Seymour from her burning house, and the two of them develop a friendship after Isabel saves her life. They return to the Locktons' home, where much of Isabel's duties consist of caring for Lady Seymour, who becomes debilitated after the horror of the fire.

When the British capture Fort Washington, all the Patriot troops are thrown in the British prison not far from the pump where Isabel gets the Locktons' water. Isabel learns that Curzon is among them, and begins bringing leftover food to the prison. When she sees that the other soldiers are mistreating him because he is a slave, she makes a deal to deliver messages to their captain, who is out on parole in the city. Isabel thought her spy days were behind her, but she can't just let her friend die.

Isabel's double life as a slave and Patriot spy gets majorly disrupted when Madam learns of her activities. In her string of verbal abuse, Madam lets it slip that she actually still owns Ruthâ€”because she couldn't find a buyer for her, Ruth was sent to the Lockton estate in Charleston. Isabel is understandably pretty upset about this, so Madam locks Isabel in a potato bin and threatens to have Ruth drowned as a punishment for helping the Patriots.

Knowing that Ruth is still in the Colonies gives Isabel the courage to bust out of the Locktons' house. She steals a pass from Lockton that declares that she is a free slave, gives herself a new name, and leaves.

She is about to steal a boat and row across the river to New Jersey when she remembers how kind Curzon has always been to her, and knowing that she can't leave him behind, she goes to the prison and pretends to be cleaning cells. She finds Curzon lying on the floor, delirious with fever, and tells the guard that he's dead. When he gives her permission for her to take him to the pile of bodies outside, she puts him in a wheelbarrow and takes off for the dock.

Curzon and Isabel get a boat and row like mad across the river before collapsing unconscious on the New Jersey banks. When she realizes she's gotten the two of them out of New York to safety, she asks Curzon if he's able to get up and walkâ€¦ and the story continues in Forge, the next book in the series.

		<h2>Chapter 1 Summary</h2>
		<a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
		<div class="content">
		Monday, May 27, 1776
Our heroine, Isabel, and her younger sister, Ruth, are on their way to the funeral of a woman named Miss Mary Finch, along with a pastor, the wagon driver, and Mary's nephew and only living relative, Robert, who's kind of a jerk. He didn't waste any time getting to her Rhode Island home to care for herâ€”and snatch up her money after she died.
Isabel leaves the funeral procession to visit the nearby grave of her mother, who died of smallpox a year before. Things get kind of Poltergeist-like when Isabel starts talking to the grave, saying that the day they've been waiting for has finally come and asking her ghost to make a brief appearance to give her instructions on where to go next. 
Miss Mary's funeral is about to begin, and Robert shouts at Isabel to join him in the cemetery for white folks. We learn that Isabel and Ruth are slaves, and Miss Mary was their owner.

		<div class="content">
		Monday, May 27, 1776
The funeral ends, and Isabel is nervous and jittery. She approaches the pastor, asking him where she and Ruth are to stay while she looks for workâ€”Miss Mary freed the girls in her will, which Isabel read herself after it was composed.
Unfortunately, this doesn't go over too well with Robert. Actually, it doesn't go over at all, because he doesn't believe her. He doesn't even believe that Isabel can read and threatens to beat her for lying, even though his aunt actually taught her how.
You're probably wondering why someone doesn't just bust out a copy of the will as proof to this matter. In fact, this is impossibleâ€”Miss Mary's lawyer is stuck in Boston because of a military blockade. Plus, Robert is just unwilling to investigate Isabel's claim, and declares that the girls now belong to him.
At least for now. Isabel's nervousness turns to fear when Robert announces that he plans on selling her and Ruth. The girls were sold once before when they were much younger, and it was really traumatic. Her father was sold to a different owner, and when he put up a fight over being separated from his wife and children, he was beaten until his blood ran in the dust. Isabel begins to prepare herself for the frightening unknown of her coming sale.

Apparently, slaves are so considered to be property that they are allowed no possessions of their own. Robert takes the girls back to Miss Mary's to gather their blankets and shoes, believing that having these items will help them fetch a better price. They must leave everything else behind, including Ruth's doll and items that belonged to their parents; Isabel, however, cheats on this rule and takes a pocketful of Momma's seeds from a jar
They travel to a tavern in Newport where Ruth and Isabel will be auctioned off. The owner's wife, Jenny, takes the sisters to the kitchen and gives them food. She tells them that she was a close friend of Momma's, and Isabel begs Jenny to buy her and Ruth, but Jenny says she cannot. 
Isabel and Ruth are sold on the front steps of the tavern to Elihu and Anne Lockton, a merchant and his wife from New York. 
At the last minute, Jenny surprises everyone by saying that she will buy the girls. Just to spite Jenny, Madam Lockton asks her husband if they can increase their offer for the girls, then asks if Jenny is able to offer more. 
Jenny goes back into the kitchen, and the Locktons take Isabel and Ruth aboard the ship to their new home.

		<h2>Chapter 5 Summary</h2>
		<a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
		<div class="content">
		Wednesday, May 29, 1776
When the ship docks in New York, Madam Lockton throws a hissy fit over a giant walnut chest that the soldiers guarding the dock want to inspect. She says it has her underwear in itâ€”back then, ladies' underwear was kind of a big deal. We've got this feeling that if Madam Lockton were alive today, she wouldn't do too well with random searches at airport security. 
While all this is going on, a friend, Charles, approaches Mr. Lockton and asks him why in the name of King George he's chosen to come back to New York. Apparently, Bellingham, a local official in charge of arresting traitors to the cause of independence, is looking for reasons to lock him up for his continued loyalty to the King.
As if on cue, Bellingham makes an appearance, accompanied by a young slave wearing a red hat. Bellingham engages the Locktons in a conversation that would sound totally ordinary, if not for the fact that they're on different sides of the Revolution. Elihu dispels rumors that he and his family have gone to London, claiming that he's on the side of Patriots, but Bellingham doesn't buy it.
The battle over Madam Lockton's walnut chest isn't over yet, though we're starting to think there might be more to this than her alleged dignity. What we do know is that there's something kind of comical about all this, and it's not lost on Ruth, who starts to giggle.
When Madam asks which one of the girls was laughing at her, Isabel quickly takes the blame, and Madam smacks her cheek harder than Isabel has ever been hit before in her life.
The Great Underwear Chest Debacle is resolved and it's decided that the Locktons can return home with it. They decide to send Isabel on ahead to get clean water. Bellingham's slave in the red hatâ€”whose name is Curzonâ€”agrees to accompany Isabel and give her the grand tour.
